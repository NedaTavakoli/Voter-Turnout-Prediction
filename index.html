<p>Last fall, 2018, the State of Georgia experienced a divisive gubernatorial election between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp fraught with explicit and systematic voter suppression <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/governor-brian-kemp-voter-suppression.html?partner=IFTTT">[1]</a>. The tactics employed by Brian Kemp and republican operatives included exact-match purging of voters from rolls and premature closure of polling locations. These tactics saw $85,000$ voters removed from the rolls in the three months leading up to the election and $667,000$ removed during 2017 <a href="">[]</a>. All told, more than 10% of eligible, primarily black, voters were removed from the rolls <a href="">[]</a>. The systematic and widespread suppression netted Brian Kemp a victory while inspiring the Fair Fight movement. In the spirit of Fair Fight, this project endeavors to predict voter turnout using machine learning techniques based on district-level infrastructure data.</p>

<p>We will leverage three machine learning methods, one supervised and two unsupervised methods. More specifically, we plan to apply logistic regression, k-means clustering and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) on our dataset. We shall use logistic regression to determine which dependent features have more effect on voter turnout.</p>

<p>Keeter et al. predicted voter turnout based on interviews, voter history, and demographics using random forest and logistic regression <a href="">[]</a>. Challenor predicted voter turnout using labor force demographics in <a href="">[]</a>. Unlike their work, we propose to predict voter turnout based on local infrastructure, including but not limited to distance from polling stations, as examined by <a href="">[]</a>.</p>
