**Datasets**

Rough Draft
Features used: No. of voters per polling location, are per polling location, no. of congregation in each county, voter purge rate, percentage broadband access.
Used data points for all counties for every state that reported county wise data.
All values were normalised by state. For example, the average voters per polling location in California is much higher than that of North Dakota. Normalising both states alike will cause the normalised features of North dakota to tend to zero.

Features were chosen because they indicated level of infrastructure in any given county. Other features to include would be a Binary for availability of public transportation. Number of public schools per county would be another one to capture "access to education". In the same vein, number of public universities with accessible financial aid and scholarships would be a good feature too. 

Our dataset has features that don't differentiate well into clusters. The problem is that the features aren't giving us any information about voter turnout.
